The slowest operations were related to finding or counting all objects that meet a certain criteria (e.g. Category, City, State). </p>\n<p>After careful consideration, I decided to reimagine the database schema in a more structured way, mapping entity relationships and how the data could be restructured for efficient query handling. I decided to benchmark Postgres, seeding the database with 10M fake projects and 100M fake users, in order to see if a relational database could outperform the NoSQL counterpart.</p>\n<p>The next step that I took was to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index\">index</a> the most important columns that I was performing operations on: <code class=\"language-text\">creator_id, category, city and state</code>. Additionally, I <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization\">denormalized</a> some of the data, duplicating count data in several tables.\nThis offered huge improvements in the query read speeds, as shown in the tables below, although at the expense of writing extra data.</p>\n<p>As a result, I ripped out MongoDB entirely, replacing it with Postgres both for the speed and structure.</p>\n<p><em>Notably, Postgres was a also a tad faster at certain operations before indexing, but still extremely slow at the same operations that MongoDB had struggled with.</em></p>\n<p>The last three steps I took were to restructure what data the frontend was actually pulling before rendering:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I limited project and search queries to 12, recognizing that not all the data needed to be pulled each time, but only 12 at time.</li>\n<li>Caching the count of certain fields such as count of projects belonging to each category, and count of projects by city and state.</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Select Project by Id</th>\n<th>Before</th>\n<th>After</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>select * from projects where id =

server before deployment.</p>\n<p>I began by load testing my server using <a href=\"https://artillery.io/\">Artillery.io</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/wg/wrk\">wrk</a> to serve as a benchmark for future tests.\nI ran into some limitations using Artillery, since it didn’t support offer <a href=\"https://artillery.io/blog/artillery-20-preview-multicore\">multicore support</a>, so I alternatively built a simple <a href=\"https://github.com/jump-starter/johnny-product-summary-module/blob/master/wrk.lua\">test script</a> for wrk using Lua.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Firstly, I made sure to optimize how node was running on my computer using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html\">node clusters</a>. Being that a single node instance runs in a single thread, this doubled the requests my server could handle by effectively using twice as much processing power on my computer.</li>\n<li>Secondly, I implemented <a href=\"https://redis.io/\">Redis</a> to create an in-memory cache, inspired from the work I had done on improving database query speeds. I designed my test script so that 20% of the pages saw 80% of the traffic, emulating a likely real-world scenario, and thus Redis did have a noticeable impact.</li>\n<li>Lastly, I made sure Node was <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html#set-node_env-to-production\">running in production mode</a>, speeding up Express.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Note: Latency: x% refers to the latency in which x% of requests finished</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Requests / Second</th>\n<th># of Errors</th>\n<th>Avg Latency (ms)</th>\n<th>Latency: 50%</th>\n<th>Latency: 75%</th>\n<th>Latency: 90%</th>\n<th>Latency: 99%</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Before Optimizatons</td>\n<td>1107.22</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>36.4</td>\n<td>34.04</td>\n<td>36.47</td>\n<td>42.69</td>\n<td>78.85</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1) Node Clustering</td>\n<td>2484.24</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>19.45</td>\n<td>13.84</td>\n<td>20.88</td>\n<td>30.6</td>\n<td>93.53</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2) Redis Caching</td>\n<td>3300.69</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>15.66</td>\n<td>10.98</td>\n<td>16.75</td>\n<td>25.24</td>\n<td>90.03</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3) Setting Node to Production</td>\n<td>3664.98</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>14.9</td>\n<td>9.55</td>\n<td>15.52</td>\n<td>24.24</td>\n<td>97.34</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<h3>3) Load Testing while Horizontally Scaling</h3>\n<p>The last step in optimization was in deployment.</p>\n<p>I deployed my application to AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">EC2</a> instances using <a href=\"https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2015/11/11/running-docker-aws-ground-up/\">Docker containers</a> and Amazon’s <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">RDS</a> to host the database.</p>\n<p>Using Amazon’s <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/what-is-load-balancing.html\">Elastic Load Balancing</a>, I began scaling my server horizontally, noticing that it was much more cost efficient than vertically scaling my single server.
